              <p> Wii Sports (Wii スポーツ Wii Supōtsu) is a sports video game developed and produced by Nintendo as a launch title for the Wii video game console, and part of the Touch! Generations brand. It was first released in the U.S.A. along with the Wii on November 19, 2006, and was released in Japan, Australia, and Europe the following month. The game is included as a pack-in game with the Wii console in all territories except Japan, making it the first game included with the launch of a Nintendo system since Mario's Tennis for the Virtual Boy in 1995. </p>
